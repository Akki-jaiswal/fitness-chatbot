## üöÄ Get Started (Local Setup)

To get the Fitness Chatbot running on your local machine:

    * Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub repository page. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
3.  **Clone Your Fork:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Akki-jaiswal/fitness-chatbot.git](https://github.com/Akki-jaiswal/fitness-chatbot.git)
    ```
4.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    You can then interact with the chatbot directly in your terminal.

## üéØ Finding Tasks & Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and features.

1.  **Check the Issues Tab:** Go to the `Issues` tab on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Akki-jaiswal/fitness-chatbot/issues](https://github.com/Akki-jaiswal/fitness-chatbot/issues)
2.  **Look for Labels:** We use labels to categorize issues and indicate their difficulty:
    * `gssoc25`: All issues eligible for GSSoC'25 contributions.
    * `good first issue` / `beginner-friendly`: Great starting points for new contributors.
    * `difficulty:easy`, `difficulty:medium`, `difficulty:hard`: Indicates the complexity.
    * `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `enhancement`, `refactor`, `nlp`: Describes the type of work.
3.  **Choose an Issue:** Select an issue that interests you and matches your skill level.

## ü§ù Contribution Workflow

Once you've chosen an issue:

1.  **Claim the Issue:**
    * **Comment on the issue** you've chosen, stating clearly: "I'd like to work on this issue."
    * This helps prevent multiple people from working on the same task.
2.  **Create a New Branch:**
    * Before making any changes, create a new branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `fix/bug-description`, `feat/new-response`).
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
3.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Implement your solution in your new branch.
    * Write clean, readable, and well-commented Python code.
    * Follow the existing code style of the project.
4.  **Test Your Changes:**
    * Ensure your changes work as expected. Test the chatbot thoroughly with various inputs related to your changes.
5.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    * Write clear and concise commit messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new response for sleep queries" # Example commit message
    ```
6.  **Push Your Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You'll see a prompt to create a Pull Request.
    * **Ensure you are creating a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the *original* repository.**
    * **Write a clear PR description:**
        * Reference the issue number it closes (e.g., `Closes #123`).
        * Explain what changes you made and why.
        * Provide examples of how to test your changes (e.g., "To test, run `python chatbot.py` and type 'how much protein?").

## üìè Code Style & Guidelines

* **Python:** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines for code style.
* **Comments:** Add comments where the code logic might not be immediately obvious, especially for complex regex patterns or context management.
* **Modularity:** Try to keep changes focused within relevant functions or logical blocks.
